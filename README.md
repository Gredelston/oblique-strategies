# Brian Eno & Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies

Since 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt have produced a deck of cards dubbed
"Oblique Strategies". Each card offers an unconventional way of approaching a
creative problem.

These cards have been released in a variety of editions, and more recently for a
variety of software platforms. This repository offers a command-line interface.

I grabbed the list of strategies from https://www.oblique.pouruntemps.com/. I
cannot guarantee that that list is canonical or endorsed by Eno and Schmidt.
Since Eno has a net worth of $60,000,000 and Peter Schmidt has been dead since
1980, I am more concerned about the authenticity of the strategies than I am
about the marginal loss to their profits. Maybe someday I'll get my hands on a
real deck to offer a more authentic option.
