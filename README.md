# Brian Eno & Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies

Since 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt have produced a deck of cards dubbed
"Oblique Strategies". Each card offers an unconventional way of approaching a
creative problem.

These cards have been released in a variety of editions, and more recently for a
variety of software platforms. This repository offers a command-line interface.

I grabbed the list of strategies from
https://mat-rickard.com/list-of-all-oblique-strategies. I am not positive that 
this list is canonical or endorsed by Eno and Schmidt, but it was the most
accurate-looking source I could find. Since Eno has a net worth of $60,000,000
and Peter Schmidt is long dead, I am more concerned about the authenticity of
the strategies than I am about the marginal loss to their profits. Maybe someday
I'll get my hands on a real deck to offer a more authentic option.
